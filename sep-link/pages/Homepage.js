    <p>This website contains a collection of texts, songs, and stories in the Atchan language (also known as Ébrié).  
        Atchan is a language spoken by the Tchaman people (also called the Ébrié people), who live in approximately sixty villages located within and near the city of Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire’s economic capital.  
        Following the classification of Williamson & Blench (2000:18), Atchan, along with its sister language Nghlwa (Mbatto), forms the Potou subgroup in the Kwa (and broader Niger-Congo) language family.  
        Through the resources on this page, you can learn more about the Tchaman people, their language, and their culture.</p> 
    
      <p>This website is a collaboration between Dr. Yao Maxime Dido, Professor of Linguistics at Université Alassane Ouattara de Bouaké (Côte d’Ivoire), and linguists at the University of California, Berkeley. 
        Dr. Dido participated in the implementation of the Atchan orthography along with Prof. Rémy Bôle-Richard, a linguist specializing in West African languages and the designer of the orthography.</p>
      
      <p>This website is intended first and foremost as a resource for the Tchaman people, and in addition for researchers who are interested in learning more about the Atchan language.</p>
